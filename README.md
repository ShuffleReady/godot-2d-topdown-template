# Notice

I am gradually releasing more in-depth documentation on my site.
For sections that are already completed I will link to the updated documentation page; 
for other sections, in the meantime, I will leave the documentation here.

In general, to learn more about a specific topic, you can directly check the code. All the important properties and functions are fully documented.
You can also try the template launching the web demo from the link above, or download and launch the project from the Godot editor (F5).
When you start working on your project, you can safely delete all the scenes that start with "playground\_" and configure your starting level in the `start_level` property of the `start_screen.tscn` scene.

## Interaction System

## Inventory

The inventory manages all the items owned by a player. The project provides a simple node (`Inventory.tscn`) assigned as a child of the player, which shows all the items owned by him. You can delete this inventory and create your own according to your preferences. Press _ESC_ on your keyboard to open/close the inventory.

## Data Management (Save/Load)

The project provides a data management system. It works in a very simple way: all nodes found in the current level (scene) with the group "save" or "player" will be handled by the save/load system. This is done by the singleton `DataManager`. By default, only data from `StateMachine` and `CharacterEntity` are handled by the system. While these should cover most use cases, you can extend their functionality to your liking via the `DataManager.gd` script.

### "save" group

- StateMachine: By assigning the group "save" to a `StateMachine`, you will save the current state of the StateMachine. This is useful, for example, to handle the state of objects or events, like the open/close state of chests or doors.
- CharacterEntity: By assigning the group "save" to a `CharacterEntity`, you will save its current position and facing direction.

### "player" group

- Player: Player data is handled differently by the save system and it is saved/loaded without the node needing to be in the "save" group (it must be in the "player" group, though). Players have a `player_entity.gd` script that contains the `get_data` and `receive_data` methods. `get_data` tells what data to save in the save file, while `receive_data` decides what to do with the incoming data from the save file (previously saved).
  The player's data saved is:
- position
- facing direction
- current hp
- max hp
- inventory
- equipped weapon id

You can extend the `PlayerEntity` class and the saved data as you like.

In all cases, the data will be saved and kept even when moving from one level to another (using a `Transfer`). The data is lost if you close the game without saving (to a file). It is possible to save the data quickly thanks to the singleton `Debugger`, by pressing the _F1_ key on the keyboard.
You can also return to the main title by pressing the _F2_ key.

## State Machines

https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/state-machines

## Scenes Transition

Transition between scenes is managed by `SceneManager.gd` from [baconandgames](https://github.com/baconandgames). For more information check out the [official repository](https://github.com/baconandgames/godot4-game-template).

## User Prefs

User preferences (like music settings or language) are also managed by scripts from [baconandgames](https://github.com/baconandgames). For more information check out the [Godot 4 Game Template](https://github.com/baconandgames/godot4-game-template). In the project, you can access them through the `SettingsMenu` (`settings_menu.gd`).

## Dialogue System

Dialogues are managed by the plugin `DialogueManager` (version 3.0) from [nathanhoad](https://github.com/nathanhoad). For more information check out the [official repository](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager).

## Tilemaps

To easily manage TileMap terrains, the plugin `TileBitTools` from [dandeliondino](https://github.com/dandeliondino) has been added to the project. To find out how to set up Terrains, check out the [official repository](https://github.com/dandeliondino/tile_bit_tools).

## Debugger

Debugging is managed by the Autoload `Debugger`. Check out the `debugger.gd` script to find out what offers and add your debugging methods.

## Localization

Localization is managed by the default localization system of Godot. The project offers two already configured languages: _English_ (en) and _Italian_ (it). Check out the `local` folder to find out all the translated strings.
To manage the list of languages you can check the constant `LANGUAGES` in `Const.gd` and remove or add new languages there. Then, you have to create a corresponding `.translation` file in the `local` folder and add (or remove) it in _Project Settings -> Localization_.

## Levels

A level is a game area where playable characters, NPCs, any enemies, and props are present. The base node for levels is `Level.tscn`, which has attached the script `level.gd`. The Level node can be used as a starting node for creating new levels. It already has a structure of nodes within it, making it fully functional. Exploring the present nodes, we find:

- Shaker
- GameCamera2D
- Layers
- Props
- Entities
- Transfers
- Events

#### Shaker
Useful to shake the screen. To shake the screen just call the method `play_shake` on the node using a `StateCallable`.

#### GameCamera2D

The main `GameCamera2D` of the level. It has the script `game_camera.gd` attached, useful to define a camera's target to follow:

- `target_player_id`: you can set a value corresponding to the `player_id` of the player to follow (see PlayerEntity). Setting a value greater than 0 will search within the level for the player with the corresponding `player_id`. Setting the value to 0 will not search for any player, and only the `target` field will be checked.
- `target`: if you want the camera to follow any node (that is not a player), you can assign the node to follow in this field.

#### Layers

This is the parent node that hosts all the `TileMapLayer` nodes of the level. `TileMapLayer` nodes are used to draw a level using tiles.
Regarding the tileset, to facilitate the definition of Terrain Sets, the `TileBitTools` plugin has been added. For information on how TileBitTools works, refer to its [repository](https://github.com/dandeliondino/tile_bit_tools).

#### Props

You can use this node as a parent to keep the props you add to the level. Props can be interactive elements or simple non-interactive decorations in the level.

#### Entities

You can use this node as a parent to keep the entities you add to the level. Entities are the gameâ€™s characters.
Here you can add `Marker2D` nodes with a `player_instantiator.gd` script to indicate the spawn position of each player. The `player_instantiator.gd` script will handle instantiating a player at the `Marker2D` position with the defined `player_id`.

#### Transfers

You can use this node as a parent to keep the transfers you add to the level. A Transfer allows the player to move from one level to another. Check the `transfer.gd` script to learn more.

#### Events

You can use this node as a parent to keep the events you add to the level. Events are state machines that trigger a sequence of states, useful for creating cutscenes or automated character movements.

### Transfer

Parent node that contains the script `transfer.gd` that performs the transfer, with the following parameters:

- `level_path`: the path of the level to transfer to. Leave empty if you want to move within the same level
- `destination_name`: the name of the node to use as a reference to set the destination position. This node should have assigned the "destination" group to work properly
- `facing`: changes the facing direction of the player, forcing it to face the direction configured here. Useful if the starting Transfer is East, so the player is facing right when interacting with it, but the destination is North, so the player will need to face down upon arriving.
